## This example demonstrates method chaining
## Method chaining allows the familiar object oriented notation,
## However, chaining doesn't make use of classes
## chaining uses the -> postfix operator
## On the right hand side of the arrow a function call is required
## the left hand side of the argument is subsituted in as the first argument of the function on the right

  ->filter(fn(x:int) bool => x > 10)
  ->sort(fn(a:int b:int) int => a - b)
  ->map(fn(x) => x->toString[int])
