# Achernar

Achernar is a *WIP* multi paradigm programming language focusing on:

* **Minimalism**: Achernar strives to be orthagonal. Language features are simple to understand, independent, and highly composable.
* **Versatility**: Achernar is designed to be 100% compatible with any build system or project setup. The compiler and standard library have no dependencies, and can easily be dropped into any project
* **Safety**: Achernar is strongly typed, and intends to support Ada style contracts. In the future it aims to focus on static analysis and abstract interpretation.

### Motivating factors

There are several design goals for Achernar:

* Fully public domain source code
  * Achernar is fully public domain, which means that you are free to embed it anywhere, without attribution.
* 1:1 Correspondance with AST. 
  * Means that the comments, macros, and code should all be representable from the AST with no data loss. 
  * This eases the implementation of code transforming tools such as formatters, static analyzers, and machine learning tools
* Comment integration with code
  * Achernar defines which expression, statement, type, or macro a comment applies to. 
  * Enables code formatters will be able to better respect comment placement and formatting
  * It can also be used to generate more specific documentation and 
* No Redundancy
  * Unify `if`, `switch`, and the ternary operator (`?`) into `match`
  * Unify `while(...)`,`do { } while(...)`, and `for(...)` into `loop`
    * We can use the iterator's `foreach` callback function to handle looping over a collection
* No semicolons
  * Semicolons are made redundant if the grammar is unambiguous
  * Achernar takes Lua's approach by prohibiting language features that would make it impossible to distinguish the end of a statement from the beginning of another.
 
 
### Build & Installation Instructions

To install Achernar, git clone the repository and run make in `bootstrap1`. Requires `clang` or `gcc` to compile.

```bash
$ cd bootstrap1
$ make
```

### Run Instructions

Once you've built Achernar, you should be able to find the binary in the `obj` folder

```bash
$ ./obj/achernar
```

At the moment, it only serves as a REPL, but it will change as more features are introduced.
 
### Code examples

Here are some examples of what Achernar code looks like. 

#### Hello World

```
_sysembed` com_io `

com::io:println("hello")

```

The `_sysembed` is an intrinsic macro, and enables embedding files inside this one. It includes the namespace com::io. Functions from this namespace are utilized in the next line to print a string. Note that semicolons are not necessary.

#### Declaring variables and functions
```
# you can comment a statement
val my_string := "string"

# type inference is available, but you can additionally annotate variables by placing a colon after their name
val my_int:i32 := 500


# Achernar has first class functions. 
val double_this := fn(example_name:i32):i32 => example_name*2

#{ 
  Block Comments
  Are Also Possible
}#

double_this(my_int)
```

All functions are defined through the syntax shown above. This is because functions are a kind of value themselves.

#### Fizzbuzz 
```
_sysembed` com_io `
_sysembed` com_alloc `
_sysembed` com_format `

val allocator := com::alloc::system();

val i := 0
# we name this loop " 'x ". The tick ahead of the x means that it is a label for the loop. It introduces a new scope 'x
loop 'x {
    # here we utilize tuples (aka product types) to unite i % 5 and i % 3 into one value that we match on
    # the "," operator unites two values into a tuple
    i % 3, i % 5  match {
    # this pattern matches if both i % 3 and i % 5 evaluate to zero
    # this  pattern deconstructs the tuple, using the "," operator, which in a pattern context splits the tuple
    pat ==0, ==0  => "fizzbuzz"
    # patterns are evaluated in order, so this pattern would be checked next
    # it will run when the counter is divisible by 3
    # The "_" pattern will match any operator
    pat ==0, _    => "fizz"
    # this will run when the counter is divisible by 5
    pat _  , ==0  => "buzz"
    # otherwise, we convert the int to a string
    # because this process requires the allocation of memory for a variable length string, we also pass the allocator object
    # when we free this allocator, all memory allocated with it will be released
    pat _ => com::format::int_to_str(i, allocator)
  } # The Arrow operator subsitutes the left hand operand into the first argument of the right hand side function 
    ->com_io_printf()
    
  # increment  counter
  i += 1
  # this match statement decides whether to terminate the loop
  i match {
    # we return "nil" from the scope 'x
    pat > 100 => ret 'x nil
    # do nothing if i is less than or equal to 100
    pat _ => nil
  }
}

# free all memory
allocator->com::alloc::free()

```
This example demonstrates how to branch, loop, and allocate memory.


### Comparison with other languages

The goal of making a minimalistic low level C based language is nothing new, several other projects such as: Zig, Nim, Kit, and V have all tried. I have compiled a table of some heuristics to compare between them:
