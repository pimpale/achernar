# This example demonstrates method chaining
# Method chaining allows the familiar object oriented notation,
# However, chaining doesn't make use of classes
# chaining uses the -> postfix operator
# On the right hand side of the arrow a function call is required
# the left hand side of the argument is subsituted in as the first argument of the function on the right
